# Intro

I want to eventually build my own tumblr theme for keyboardpirate.tumblr.com and comfyquiet.tumblr.com.

Since these were free (I edited theme a little bit) I've added them here for preparation/ideas. The names aren't accurate but I don't think I'm breaching any copyrights for calling them box-theme or grey-theme.

Feature Tracking:
I'll track changes like I've done [here](https://trello.com/b/bpMw7Bm1/project-cqtheme) on this [new board](https://trello.com/b/LFeDBB0s/project-gitify-tumblr-changes).
